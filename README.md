### Hello there 😊

Hi, I'm Tony and I've been a software developer for a number of years now.

I build all sorts of interactive graphical applications (mostly) for the web.

Like what you might ask!?

- 3D data visualisations for things such as climate data, finance, sports, music, you name it!
- Medical imaging applications for detecting and measuring tumours.
- A brain surgery simulator!
- A clinical mental health trial with Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust to aid people in coping with mental health issues.
- A 3D project configurator for a marketing company to let customers configure what they want before buying it.
- Car driving simulators in Unity.
- Virtual environments, childrens games, AR apps...

I've been quite busy 😁!

I'm always open to new work opportunities, please get in touch if you would like to talk about a new project.

Tony. 👍
