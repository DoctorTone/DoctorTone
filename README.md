### Hello there üòä

Hi, I'm Tony and I've been a software developer for a number of years now.

I build all sorts of interactive graphical applications (mostly) for the web.

Like what!?

3D data visualisations for things such as climate data, finance, sports, music, you name it!
Medical imaging applications for detecting and measuring tumours.
A brain surgery simulator!
A clinical mental health trial with Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust to aid people in coping with mental health issues.
A 3D project configurator for a marketing company to let customers configure what they want before buying it.
Car driving simulators in Unity.
Virtual environments, childrens games, AR apps...

I've been quite busy!

I'm always open to new work opportunities, please get in touch if you would like to collaborate on a project.

Tony. üëç
